# Week 3

This week in the homework it is required to build a model for Natural numbers.

```
Nat ::= Zero | Succ(Nat)
```

Requirements:
* all `???` must be implemented;
* it is not allowed to use Scala 2 syntax if Scala 3 syntax is applicable (i.e. curly braces `{...}` instead of semicolon `:` and tabulations).
